# Find-the-hidden-word
This project is about a game called "Find the hidden word". The program shows in console the  word with only the first letter visiable and other letters hidden with asterisks (*).  You should guess the other letters and write character by character to make the word visible. The limit for trying is ten times. I hope you enjoyed! :)
